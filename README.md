The H1EmuLauncher is an application that aims to make playing the H1Emu project simple and easy without requiring any technical knowledge. It's easy to play on H1Emu verified servers, connect to custom servers using an IP address or simply play Singleplayer mode. The H1EmuLauncher allows players to easily download the correct version of Just Survive, install latest or stable builds of server files, keep patches and required game files up to date, display new project update information on the main page, direct users to bug report submission pages and more!

## H1EmuLauncher Tutorial

1. Simply download the launcher installer and run it (accepting any UAC prompts).
2. Set the directory of your game files using the textbox on the main page via the arrow button.
3. If you want to play on H1Emu verified servers, you must create an account at [H1Emu](https://h1emu.com) and retrieve your Account Key. Then, navigate to the **Settings > Account Key** page and paste your key into the textbox to save it. You can now start playing by simply hitting the Play button!
**Note: Account Keys are only needed for H1Emu verified servers.**
5. If you want to connect to custom servers, select the **New Server...** button from the server selector drop down menu, input an IP address and a server name of your choice and hit Play.
6. If you want to play Singleplayer, navigate to the **Settings > Game Files** page and click either the **Latest** or **Stable** server build. Then, from the server selector drop down menu, select **Singleplayer** and hit Play.
